WebAPI-OnBehalfOf-DotNet
========================

In this sample, native client calls a web API and then the web API calls another downstream web API after obtaining a token to act On Behalf Of the original user.  The sample uses the Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) in the native client to obtain a token for the user to call the first web API, and also in the first web API to get a token to act on behalf of the user to call the second web API.  Both flows use the OAuth 2.0 protocol to obtain the tokens.

This sample is coming soon!  Watch this space.
